# Title: Pantry Inventory App

## Link to site: 

## Description:
The goal of this app is to assist the local food pantry to track inventory of food staples. Client “purchases” can be entered and tracked based on client id. This app will eliminate the use of multiple spreadsheets to track inventory, client demographics, and allow for better planning.
 
## User Group:
This app will be used by a few admins of the local pantry. All data will be secured and only accessible by the admins.

## User Flow:
